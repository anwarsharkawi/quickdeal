### Grouping Credits / Debits
-  Suppose you went on a trip to bangalore. Now you want to know the entire expenses on your trip. You can filter the expenses and then select / unselect the expenses and move them to another tap called grouped. The grouped tab shows a subset of your expenses from the main screen that you have tagged under the new title, in this case 'Bangalore Trip'.
